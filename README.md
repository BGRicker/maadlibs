Happies:

* pull up a song, swaps out bad words with an array of words you choose
* hosted on www.maadlibs.com

Sads:

* nothing to set up multiple words: "Guy Fieri" ends up as ["Guy", "Fieri"]
* maybe need a better way to hide urls, you can add any /number and get
  someone's song
* no tests, yolo
* might be some goofed up indentation after using some of a bootstrap template
